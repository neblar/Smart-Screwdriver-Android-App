### What is this for? ###

* This App was made solely to work with the Arduino Implementation of the screwdriver which you can visit at: https://bitbucket.org/rijulg/smart-screwdriver/overview
* This app provides with a GUI to interact with the Arduino over Bluetooth 2.0 and make use of the functionalities that are implemented in the arduino version's repository.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Download the repository.
* Open the project in Android Studio.
* Connect your phone to the computer and run the app, or alternately make an apk from the studio and install on your phone.
**NOTE** This works only with the Arduino version of the project (https://bitbucket.org/rijulg/smart-screwdriver/overview) if you want to use it with something else, change the code accordingly
